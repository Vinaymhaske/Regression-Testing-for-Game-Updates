# Regression Testing for Game Updates

This repository contains the code and documentation for managing regression testing for game updates, patches, and DLC.

## Overview
This project focuses on conducting regression testing to ensure the stability and reliability of game updates and patches. By collaborating with developers and prioritizing testing efforts, we aim to prevent issues and reduce post-release defects, ultimately boosting customer satisfaction.

## Key Features
- Managed regression testing for game updates, patches, and DLC.
- Collaborated with developers to prioritize testing and communicate defects effectively.
- Reduced post-release defects through robust regression testing.

## Usage
TBD - Include instructions on how to set up and run the regression testing framework.
